    "# Part 1: Understanding the Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What is a Language Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Analogy:\n",
    "Imagine you're learning to predict the next word in a sentence by reading millions of books:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The capital of Nigeria is ___\"\n",
    "→ Model predicts: \"Abuja\" (because it saw this pattern many times)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How to register a business ___\"\n",
    "→ Model predicts: \"in Nigeria\" (learned from similar texts)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what a language model does! It learns patterns from text and predicts what comes next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Llama 3?\n",
    "- **Llama 3**: A powerful language model made by Meta\n",
    "- **8B version**: 8 billion parameters (think: 8 billion \"weights\" that make decisions)\n",
    "- **Pre-trained**: Already learned from trillions of words from the internet\n",
    "- **General knowledge**: Knows about many topics (geography, science, history, etc.)\n",
    "- **But**: Not specialized in your specific domain (Nigerian government services)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is Fine-Tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem:\n",
    "Llama 3 is great at general knowledge, but if you ask it about specific Nigerian government services, it might not be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution:\n",
    "**Fine-tuning** = Teaching the model to become an expert in your specific domain\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. Start with Llama 3 (general knowledge model)\n",
    "2. Show it examples from your domain (Nigerian government Q&A)\n",
    "3. Model adjusts its weights to specialize in this domain\n",
    "4. Result: A model that's great at answering Nigerian government questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pre-trained model ≈ A medical student with 4 years of general training\n",
    "Fine-tuning ≈ 6 months of specialization in cardiology\n",
    "Fine-tuned model ≈ A cardiologist (general knowledge + specialization)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Why LoRA? (Low-Rank Adaptation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Full Fine-Tuning:\n",
    "- Llama 3 has **8 billion parameters** (adjustable values)\n",
    "- Training all 8B parameters takes **days** and uses **100+ GB GPU memory**\n",
    "- Very expensive! ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LoRA?\n",
    "LoRA is a clever trick:\n",
    "- Instead of modifying all 8B parameters, we add **small adapter layers**\n",
    "- Only train ~42M parameters (0.5% of total)\n",
    "- Result: **Same quality but 2x faster and 60% less memory** ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "### How LoRA Works (Simplified):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traditional: Update big matrix (8000×8000) - SLOW\n",
    "LoRA: Update small matrices (8000×16) + (16×8000) - FAST\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined effect is similar to updating the big matrix!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Savings:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Full fine-tuning: 40 GB memory\n",
    "LoRA: 16 GB memory (4x savings!)\n",
    "LoRA + 4-bit: 8 GB memory (5x savings!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔢 What is 4-bit Quantization?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Model weights take lots of memory\n",
    "```\n",
    "Weight stored as: 32-bit number = 0.123456789 (32 bits = 4 bytes)\n",
    "Model with 8B parameters = 8B × 4 bytes = 32 GB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Use smaller numbers (4-bit instead of 32-bit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Weight stored as: 4-bit number ≈ 0.1 (4 bits = 0.5 bytes)\n",
    "Model with 8B parameters = 8B × 0.5 bytes = 4 GB\n",
    "Memory savings: 8x! 🎉\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does this work?\n",
    "- Most weights don't need high precision\n",
    "- 4-bit numbers are \"close enough\" for inference\n",
    "- Minimal quality loss with slight accuracy trade-off\n",
    "- Like taking a photo in 4-bit color instead of 32-bit - you lose some gradients but image is still recognizable\n",

    "# Part 2: Understanding Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔤 What is a Token?\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models don't understand words—they understand **numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenization** = Converting text into numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text: \"Hello Nigeria\"\n",
    "       ↓ (tokenization)\n",
    "Tokens: [15339, 29878]  (These are just numbers!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a token?\n",
    "A token is typically:\n",
    "- A word: \"hello\" → 15339\n",
    "- Part of a word: \"ing\" → 29878 (from \"running\")\n",
    "- Punctuation: \".\" → 29889\n",
    "- Space: \" \" → 1 (special token)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocabulary:\n",
    "Llama 3 has a **vocabulary of 128,000 tokens**\n",
    "- Each token maps to a unique number (0-127,999)\n",
    "- The tokenizer has a lookup table for mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Text: \"How to register a business?\"\n",
    "Tokens: [29882, 304, 8369, 263, 12881, 29973]\n",
    "         ↑     ↑   ↑     ↑   ↑      ↑\n",
    "         How   to  reg   a   bus    ?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why tokenization matters for fine-tuning:\n",
    "1. Models can only process tokens, not text\n",
    "2. Longer text = more tokens = more memory\n",
    "3. This is why `MAX_SEQ_LENGTH=1024` is important (max 1024 tokens per example)\n",
    "4. Language varies: English text might tokenize differently than Yoruba\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokens vs Words:\n",
    "```\n",
    "English sentence: \"I'm going to Nigeria\"\n",
    "Words: 5 words\n",
    "Tokens: ~8 tokens (contractions and punctuation create extra tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule of thumb: 1 token ≈ 0.75 words\n",
    "1000 tokens ≈ 750 words\n",

    "## 📚 How Training Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Training Loop (Simplified):\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with pre-trained Llama 3 model\n",
    "2. Take one batch of training examples (e.g., 8 Q&A pairs)\n",
    "3. Model makes predictions on these examples\n",
    "4. Calculate LOSS = how wrong the predictions are\n",
    "5. Update model weights to reduce loss\n",
    "6. Repeat 60 times (or more for larger training)\n",
    "7. Model gets better at answering questions!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Loss?\n",
    "**Loss** measures how wrong your model's predictions are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Question: \"What is the capital of Nigeria?\"\n",
    "Reference answer: \"Abuja\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Model's first attempt: \"Lagos\"\n",
    "Loss = VERY HIGH (completely wrong) ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "After 10 training steps:\n",
    "Model predicts: \"Abuja or Lagos\"\n",
    "Loss = MEDIUM (partially correct)\n",
    "\n",
    "After 60 training steps:\n",
    "Model predicts: \"Abuja\"\n",
    "Loss = LOW (correct!) ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Formula (Simplified):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Loss = Average difference between model predictions and correct answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower loss = better model\n",
    "Higher loss = worse model\n",

    "## 🔄 Batch Size and Gradient Accumulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Batch?\n",
    "Instead of training on one example at a time, we train on multiple examples together:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 1: Q: \"How to register a business?\" A: \"Complete the FIRS form...\"\n",
    "Example 2: Q: \"What is CAC?\" A: \"Corporate Affairs Commission...\"\n",
    "Example 3: Q: \"Cost of CAC registration?\" A: \"₦50,000...\"\n",
    "           ↓\n",
    "        (Batch of 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why batch training?\n",
    "1. **More stable learning**: Average loss across multiple examples\n",
    "2. **Faster**: GPU can process multiple examples at once\n",
    "3. **Better generalization**: Model learns from diverse examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Size Configuration:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "PER_DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE = 2        # Process 2 examples at a time\n",
    "GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS = 4  # Accumulate for 4 batches\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective batch size = 2 × 4 = 8 examples before updating weights\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Gradient Accumulation?\n",
    "Your GPU might not have enough memory for batch size 8, so we:\n",
    "1. Process batch of 2 examples\n",
    "2. Calculate gradients (not weights yet)\n",
    "3. Store gradients in memory\n",
    "4. Repeat 4 times\n",
    "5. Add up all gradients\n",
    "6. Update weights once\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Same effect as batch size 8, but uses 4x less memory!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory vs Speed Trade-off:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Large batch size (32):   Fast ⚡ but needs more memory 💾\n",
    "Small batch size (2):    Slow 🐢 but uses less memory 💾\n",
    "With accumulation (2×4): Medium speed ⚡ and memory 💾\n",

    "## 🎯 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Training:\n",
    "- ✅ Prepare 500-5000 high-quality Q&A pairs\n",
    "- ✅ Verify data format (question-answer JSON)\n",
    "- ✅ Check GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`\n",
    "- ✅ Start with smaller batch sizes if unsure\n",
    "\n",
    "### During Training:\n",
    "- ✅ Monitor training/validation loss graphs\n",
    "- ✅ Watch for divergence (loss increasing)\n",
    "- ✅ Check validation loss to catch overfitting\n",
    "- ✅ Save checkpoints periodically\n",
    "\n",
    "### After Training:\n",
    "- ✅ Evaluate on test set (never seen during training)\n",
    "- ✅ Manual evaluation of sample responses\n",
    "- ✅ Calculate ROUGE scores\n",
    "- ✅ Compare to baseline model\n",
    "- ✅ Save both LoRA adapters and merged model\n",

    "## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ Using same data for train AND validation\n",
    "   → You can't detect overfitting!\n",
    "   ✅ Always keep test data separate\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Training for only 10 steps\n",
    "   → Model hasn't learned much\n",
    "   ✅ Minimum 60 steps, better with 500+\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Setting learning rate to 0.1\n",
    "   → Training will diverge immediately\n",
    "   ✅ Use 2e-4 to 5e-4 for fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Ignoring out-of-memory errors\n",
    "   → Training will crash\n",
    "   ✅ Reduce batch size or max_seq_length\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Not saving model checkpoints\n",
    "   → If training crashes, lose everything\n",
    "   ✅ Save model every 100 steps\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Using low-quality training data\n",
    "   → Model learns garbage\n",
    "   ✅ Quality matters more than quantity\n",

    "## 📊 Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Loss Progression (for 60 steps):\n",

    "Step 1:   Loss = 2.5  (random model)\n",
    "Step 10:  Loss = 1.8  (20% improvement)\n",
    "Step 30:  Loss = 0.8  (65% improvement)\n",
    "Step 60:  Loss = 0.4  (84% improvement)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is normal! Loss improvement is logarithmic.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected ROUGE Scores (after 60 steps):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Small dataset (100 examples):  ROUGE-1 ≈ 0.25-0.35\n",
    "Medium dataset (1000 examples): ROUGE-1 ≈ 0.35-0.50\n",
